> *Extreme Prompt Compression & Context Optimization, specifically designed for Agent Zero.*

The **A0 Token Optimizer** is a high-performance custom skill for Agent Zero, designed to drastically reduce API costs and maximize the efficiency of your context window. Inspired by **LLMLingua2** technology, this tool extracts the absolute essence from texts, documents, prompts, and images.

## 🏆 Key Achievements

This project uses a **"Pure Aggressive"** architecture to extract the absolute maximum in efficiency:

*   🔥 **Extreme Compression Rate (90%):** Reduces input texts and prompts to just **10% of their original size**. This means 90% fewer in-tokens and massively reduced API costs for large contexts. Additionally, the built-in token calculator keeps you up to date on your token expenses.
*   🧠 **High Semantic Quality (~88-92%):** The tool is trained to write for *Artificial Intelligence*, not for humans. While the compressed text often looks like an unreadable "keyword soup" to the human eye, it retains almost its complete semantic meaning and instructional power for LLMs.

## 🤖 Optimized for Agent Zero

Built from the ground up for seamless integration into **Agent Zero**, solving typical problems of standard compressors:

*   🐳 **Docker-Native & Systemd-Free:** Perfect for the containerized environment of Agent Zero. The daemon runs stably and continuously in the foreground, without relying on outdated `systemd` dependencies. It even survives reboots.
*   ⚡ **HTTP Daemon (Port 9199):** Instead of reloading gigantic models into memory with every call, the model runs as a resource-friendly background service. CLI tools and Agent Zero communicate at lightning speed via a local REST API.
*   🧮 **CPU-Optimized PyTorch Bundle:** Uses a custom, CPU-only PyTorch environment (`transformers v4.46.3`) to avoid compatibility issues in VPS environments.

## 📄 Advanced File and Image Processing

The optimizer is not limited to pure text but offers a comprehensive pipeline for various media:

*   **Intelligent Document Compression:** Large text files, code files, or PDFs are divided into semantically meaningful blocks by the integrated `Document Optimizer` and `Chunker`, compressed individually, and seamlessly merged back together. 
*   **Image Optimization (Vision Tokens):** The integrated `Image Optimizer` intelligently scales down images, reduces the resolution to the minimum required for vision models, and converts them into token-saving formats.
*   **Automatic File Watcher:** A background process monitors defined input folders and automatically compresses newly dropped documents and images.

## ⚙️ How it works (The "Pure Aggressive" Engine)

Instead of relying on error-prone hybrid approaches or soft fallbacks, Version 1.0 uses the **Pure Aggressive Engine**. 
Based on the powerful `microsoft/llmlingua-2-xlm-roberta-large-meetingbank` model, which downloads on the first run (requires up to 3GB). The engine forces the system to a strict retention rate of 10%. Unimportant filler words, formatting, and redundant sentence fragments are mercilessly removed, while the core facts and instructions for the target LLM are preserved.

## 🤝 Contributing & Philosophy

I am very much looking forward to forks with good improvements. Let's make AI more cost-efficient to become more discrimination-free and accessible to everyone. Since this is made for Anarcho use, if you are using the skill in a Company/Enterprise, please make me a fair
